Website: https://adidust4.github.io/comp435-final-project/

Observable Notebook: observablehq.com/@58d721f61cd5dec7/high-school-achievement-gaps-national-minnesota-outcomes

This website uses exploratory and explanatory visualizations to show trends among national high school education outcomes with respect to school district locale type. The project seeks to allow a way to explore if and how urbanity of a school district might effect students' education. The customized visualizations allow for user interaction to view what they find interesting/important.

## Motivation

This project was created for Macalester College's Fall 2021 Data Visualization (COMP-435) class final project. 
The following questions motivated this project:

- How much of the United States is still rural versus urban?
- How might region change the impact of locale on high school completion?
- What does the locale makeup of Minnesota look like?
- How does the remote nature of a rural or town locale effect high school performance?
- How does the size of a city or suburb locale effect high school performance?
- Do certain locales have greater racial disparities in high school performance?
- How do geographically close districts with different locales compare?
