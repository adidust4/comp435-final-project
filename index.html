        <h1>National & District Level Outcomes</h1>

        <br> <br>

        <h2>National Urbanicity and Outcomes</h2>

        <p>Over the last 100+ years, the United States have become increasingly urbanized. It is estimated that in 2021, 83% of the United State's population lives in some kind of urban area. With so many people living in an urban area, what does the remaining 17% experience? What do those in the <i>most</i> urban areas experience? We decided to look at this in terms of education, considered to be the great equalizer. Is education effected by district urbanicity? How might this great equalizer fail in consideration of locale type?</p>

        <h2>Minnesota Outcomes</h2>

        <p>Minnesota, like much of the Midwest, falls into a unique scenario where a majority of the land is rural and remote, but has a few large cities. This is unlike the East, where a majority of the states are urban, and the West where rural areas often aren't as remote. This makes Minnesota a unique case study, where the majority 73% of the population lives in urban areas, and a minority 8% of the population lives in remote rural areas. </p>

        <h2>Neighboring Minnesota School Districts</h2>
        <p>To get a closer look at urban-remote disparities, we look closer at two neighboring Minnesota school districts: Rockford School District and Wayzata School District. Wayzata is a small city district, whereas its neighbor Rockford is a rural fringe district. This means that despite their population densities, they have similar geography, size, and proximity to resources. This makes them a perfect way to look closer into the effects of districts that don't meet the extreme ends of urbanicity.</p>

        <!-- Sixth Data Viz - District Comparison Map-->
        <h3>Neighboring District Map</h3>
        <div id="observablehq-districtCompareMap-f75e0cf7"></div>

        <p>The Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment (M.C.A) is taken by all 11th grade Minnesota students and provides details in performance in Reading, Math, and Science. The following graphs allow for a closer look at the percent of students in Wayzata and Rockford that Exceeds Standards, Meets Standards, Partially Meets Standards, and Do Not Meet Standards in the subject MCA test in 2018. Both districts perform similarly, but Rockford Exceeds standards less and Does Not Meet Standards more than Wayzata school district students.</p>

            <div id="observablehq-districtFunding-99f30a37" class="halfgraph"></div>
            <p class="halftext">We also wanted to look at per-student funding and expenses in these two neighboring districts. Specifically, we were interested in how neighboring geographies might have different per-student revenues, expenditures, and net totals based on their different level of Urbanicity. Both districts have a net per-student between $300 and $500, but Wayzata makes more revenue per-student and has greater expenditures per student.</p>

            <div id="observablehq-districtACTChart-1983ab89" class="halfgraphopposite"></div>
            <p class="halftextopposite">The ACT is somewhat of a proxy for college-readiness, since it is a required test for many college admissions process. We compared Wayzata, Rockford, and the entirety of Minnesota, and found Rockford to be near average, whereas Wayzata was about 4 points more than the Minnesota average on this test.</p>

            <div class="halftext">
                <p>Since college is a major indicator of the social norms and responsibilities a community feels towards education, it is an excellent way to gauge how rural versus urban areas view education in their attempts to pursue it. Here we see that Rockford has slightly less than the Minnesota average percent enrolling in an institution of higher education within 16 months of graduation, whereas around 20% more than average enroll in higher education from Wayzata.</p>
