                <h2>National Urbanicity and Outcomes</h2>
                <p><em>O</em>ver the last <b>100+</b> years, the United States has become increasingly urbanized. It is estimated that in 2021, <b>83%</b> of the United State's population lives in some kind of urban area. With so many people living in an urban area, what does the remaining <b>17%</b> experience? What do those in the <i>most</i> urban areas experience? We decided to look at this in terms of education, considered to be the great equalizer. Is education affected by district urbanicity? How might this great equalizer fail in consideration of locale type?</p>

                <p>We're going to continue exploring time-based change. However, we now narrow our focus to a certain subset of states that represent a wide range of US regions (Connecticut from the Northeast, Wyoming from the Rockies and Plains area, Louisiana from the South, New Mexico from the West, and Minnesota from the Midwest). Going further, we also break up each state into its locale categories (Rural, Town, Suburb, and City). What specific correlations may there be between a high school outcome like dropout rate and where the high school's district is, both within the country and within the state? How might these correlations vary or shift over time?

                <p><em>M</em>innesota, like much of the Midwest, falls into a unique scenario where a majority of the land is rural and remote, but has a few large cities. This is unlike the East, where a majority of the states are urban, and the West where rural areas often aren't as remote. This makes Minnesota a unique case study, where the majority <b>73%</b> of the population lives in urban areas, and a minority <b>8%</b> of the population lives in remote rural areas. </p>

            </div>

                <p line-height= "0em;" font-size= "12px;" class="pcondensed">Using Minnesota as a case study, how might locale influence high school outcomes like dropout rates and test scores? How might locale influence different groups of high schoolers differently? The following interactive graphic attempts to explore those questions. 
                    <br> <br>
                    When comparing the average outcomes of four categories of locale (Rural school districts, Town school districts, Suburb school districts, and City school districts), differences are noticeable, but differences that persist across all three outcomes aren't. Explore the data yourself: use the dropdown menu to switch between the three outcomes to see how each locale performs on average. Note: The ACT College Readiness Benchmark (CRB) is a benchmark score designated to represent college preparedness. In the year represented, 2017-2018, the CRBs were 18 for English, 22 for Math, 22 for Reading, and 23 for Science. The outcome represented here is the rate of students who met the benchmark for all four of those categories.
                    <br> <br>
                    When you dig into more precise locale categories, however, consistent trends are more noticeable. When you look at rural and town school districts, remote and/or distant districts consistently do worse than "fringe" districts (districts that are near suburban or urban areas), and large city school districts consistently do much worse than small and mid-size city districts. It seems that the "extremes" (large city school districts and remote school districts) suffer. Explore the data yourself by toggling between the locale category choices, as well as continuing to switch between outcomes as desired.
                    <br> <br>
                    Of course, not all students in each school district have access to the same resources. Specifically, race-based inequities are very prevalent in the education system. While exploring at the dropout outcome, add further comparison by checking & unchecking the white student dropout checkbox. It's clear that race-based outcome differences not only exist, and not only differ based on locale, but also are the most pronounced in the suffering areas I mentioned above -- large city districts and remote rural & town districts.
                    <br> <br>
                    It's clear, from this data, that specificity matters. Minnesota as a state may have certain test scores or dropout rates, but a rural school district performs differently than a suburb school district, a remote rural differently than a fringe rural. Digging deeper, white students have different dropout rates than students as a whole.

                <h2>Neighboring Minnesota School Districts</h2>
                <p><em>T</em>o get a closer look at urban-remote disparities, we look closer at two neighboring Minnesota school districts: Rockford School District and Wayzata School District. Wayzata is a small city district, whereas its neighbor Rockford is a rural fringe district. This means that despite their population densities, they have similar geography, size, and proximity to resources. This makes them a perfect way to look closer into the effects of districts that don't meet the extreme ends of urbanicity.</p>

                <p>The Minnesota Comprehensive Assessment (M.C.A) is taken by all 11th grade Minnesota students and provides details in performance in Reading, Math, and Science. The following graphs allow for a closer look at the percent of students in Wayzata and Rockford that Exceeds Standards, Meets Standards, Partially Meets Standards, and Do Not Meet Standards in the subject MCA test in 2018. Both districts perform similarly, but Rockford Exceeds standards less and Does Not Meet Standards more than Wayzata school district students.</p>

                    <p class="halftext">We also wanted to look at per-student funding and expenses in these two neighboring districts. Specifically, we were interested in how neighboring geographies might have different per-student revenues, expenditures, and net totals based on their different level of Urbanicity. Both districts have a similar net total per-student (within the $300-$500 range) but Wayzata makes more revenue per student and has greater expenditures per student.

                        <p>Since college is a major indicator of the social norms and responsibilities a community feels towards education, it is an excellent way to gauge how rural versus urban areas view education in their attempts to pursue it. Here we see that Rockford has slightly less than the Minnesota average percent enrolling in an institution of higher education within 16 months of graduation, whereas around 20% more than average enroll in higher education from Wayzata.</p>
